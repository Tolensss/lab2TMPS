## Abstract Factory
The Abstract Factory design pattern is used in the BasicAudioComponentFactory class to provide concrete implementations of the AudioComponentFactory interface's createMediaFile(), createAudioEffect(), and createVisualization() methods. The BasicAudioComponentFactory creates different types of audio components (i.e. media files, audio effects, and visualizations) based on user input.
